Escorted by her entourage, the lizardfolk Queen emerged. She approached the sacrifice, her slitted pupils narrowing in intrigue as she scrutinized his fear-stricken expression. A chilly sensation slid across the sacrifice's neck: it was the slick, forked tongue of the lizardfolk Queen. \nThe green mist thickened, and the sacrifice emitted a long, agonized scream as the poison eroded his skin, dissolved his organs, and melted his bones—the process being dragged out for as long as possible for the Queen's personal amusement... Finally, the sacrifice ceased to exist, and what was left of him rolled across the floor—a clean skull. \n\"Pick it up,\" commanded the Queen to an attendant. \"Given that his screams were sufficiently pleasant, I grant this cranium the right to adorn the foot of my throne.\"",

They claim that when faced with formidable enemies, he would always be the first one to flee, and that this skill was precisely what allowed him to be the sole survivor in every single party he joined, enabling him to conceal the true circumstances that went on and claim credit for his teammates' achievements. \nAs for whether this is true, it would be best to clarify with Caraman himself.",

To his surprise, he seemed to have an innate instinct for sensing danger. As a seasoned adventurer who has managed to stay alive and be relatively unscathed to this day, he considers himself very fortunate. \nRegarding the rumors of him abandoning his teammates... Well, Caraman would always dutifully warn his teammates when they were no match for their upcoming enemies, and always obtained approval before he retreated each time—albeit with disdainful remarks from his team that he needn't follow if he was afraid. Caraman could only shrug at their response. After all, it was impossible to force anyone who had no intention of escaping to do so.",
